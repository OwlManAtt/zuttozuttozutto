# ZuttoZuttoZutto
Welcome to ZuttoZuttoZutto, a completely free virtual pet game framework for you to build upon.

Zutto is a successor to Kitto, written for the modern era. It is written for PHP 7 with the Lumen framework (a stripped-down version of Laravel), takes advantages of modern PHP tools like Composer, and has a first-class mobile experience thanks to Bootstrap.

## Project Status
The project is currently **IN DEVELOPMENT**. It's not complete enough for use, sorry!

## Architecture
Zutto is made up of several components:

- zutto-api - PHP backend w/ application logic and database
- zutto-ui - Single-page Vue.js application with the HTML/etc

## Installation
An install guide will be provided when the project nears a v1.0.0 release!

## Post-Installation
TODO

## Thanks
Zutto is brought to you by owls <owlmanatt@gmail.com> and the Yasashii Syndicate.
